## Problem Set 5

Write a .js program that uses console.log to print all the integers between 1 and 100, except in three situations:

If an integer in the counter is divisible by 3, print "Fizz";

if an integer in the counter is divisible by 5, print "Buzz";

if an integer in the counter is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

The first 5 integers in the console should look like this:
	
						1
						2
						Fizz
						4
						Buzz

Hints:
- You'll need three if/else blocks chained together
- You'll need the operator %
- You'll need need to do some basic math to come up with one of the blocks
