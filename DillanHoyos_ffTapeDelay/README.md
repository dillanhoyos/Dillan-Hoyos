This is my Final project, every file is inside this folder including a AU build and a VST3 build, to access to the program this folder has to be added into the plugin folder of ableton so the pluign is recognizable. 
I modified the Color and the Names of the knobs, also i modified the range of the feedback knob. 



Im glad I took this class Rachel, getting the fundamentals is really important to start exploring the world of coding and sharing knowledge within the internet, Thank you for this Semester and I hope to see you in the future. 
Best Dillan.














This is a simple Audio Plug-In using JUCE, see www.juce.com.
It was made to check out the facilities and how to use
AudioProcessorValueTreeState
It features loading/saving of a plugins complete state.
To have some fun, it is a simple delay with feedback.
Apropos feedback, feedback is very welcome:
